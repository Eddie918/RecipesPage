## Description

This project is a simple recipe web page, created using HTML. It showcases the 
ability to structure web content in a meaningful, accessible way.

## Usage

To view the recipe page, simply open the `index.html` file in any web browser. 

## Features

- Clear, straightforward layout.
- Use of various HTML elements including headers, paragraphs, links, images, lists, 
and tables.
- Semantic HTML for better accessibility and SEO.
- Mobile responsive design.

## How It's Made

The recipe page is created using HTML5. Here's a brief overview of what each file in 
the project does:

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file. It contains all the structure and 
content of the web page.

## What I Learned

While creating this recipe page, I improved my knowledge of HTML by working with 
different tags, embedding images and links, structuring a page using semantic 
elements, and creating a visually appealing design. 

## Future Improvements

- Add CSS and JavaScript to enhance the look and functionality of the page.
- Make the page more interactive by adding forms to allow users to add their own 
recipes.
